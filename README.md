# Overview

I wanted to learn more about C# and get a better understanding of how to use classes with different functions to make a project.

I created a recipe management system that uses two main classes, a receipe and recipe maker with different functions to run the main project.

This was to help me get a better foundation of knowledge about the C# language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Make it easier for the user to find stored recipes.
- I could connect this to a database for longer storage of the information for each user.
- I could update the ingredients to be a checkbox so users can check off each item as they make the recipes.
